# RSA-Parallelization

Welcome to the RSA-Parallelization repository! This project is focused on implementing a multithreaded server that serves normal client chat/information exchange with parallel RSA encryption integrated. The goal is to eventually stream media with encryption in real-time.

## Features

- **Multithreaded Server**: Efficient handling of multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **RSA Encryption**: Secure communication using RSA encryption for chat and data exchange.
- **Media Streaming**: Future plans to include streaming media with integrated encryption.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Source code directory containing all the necessary files for the server.
- `README.md`: The file you're reading right now, providing an overview of the project.
- `Sequential vs Parallel.png`: An image illustrating the performance comparison.
- `a1.out`: Compiled binary file for the project.
- `multithreaded_pinging.cpp`: C++ source file for the multithreaded server.
- `output.txt`: Sample output from the server.
- `prime_gen.py`: Python script for generating prime numbers for RSA encryption.
- `sample_text.txt`: Sample text file used for testing.
- `try.cpp`: Additional C++ source file.
- `websites.txt`: Text file containing a list of websites.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the `src/` directory. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler and run the resulting binary to start the server.
